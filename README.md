# wb353

This is the final project I handed in for CMPT 353 at the University of Sasaktchewan, in 2023.
It could be a lot better, and is far from perfect, or even useful, but I learned a lot and used good programming practice to create this project, with the intent of minimizing technical debt.

Tools used:
    - React JS
    - Node JS
    - MySQL
    - Docker
    - Tailwind CSS
    - HTML

Notable issues (that were not required for 100%):
    - Can like and dislike posts and comments infinitely, one user can give infinite likes or dislikes
    - No backtracking button, need to refresh webpage to go "back"
